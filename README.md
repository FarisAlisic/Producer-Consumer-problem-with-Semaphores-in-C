# **Producer - Consumer problem with Semaphores in C**

## __(WebPage Simulation)__

This project provides a clear and practical demonstration of how semaphores regulate concurrency in operating systems. By simulating producers and consumers within a shared retail environment, the system illustrates key concepts such as mutual exclusion, controlled access to shared buffers, and event-based synchronization. The use of empty, full, and mutex semaphores shows how operating systems coordinate resource availability and prevent race conditions, while the visualization layer makes these interactions accessible and easy to follow.

Through its modular architecture, structured codebase, and real-time feedback, the simulator effectively bridges theoretical knowledge with observable behavior. It highlights the strengths of semaphore-based synchronization and demonstrates how even simple primitives can support complex interactions in a concurrent system. Although the current implementation is functional and educational, future enhancements such as multithreading, priority scheduling, and richer analytics would bring the simulator even closer to realistic OS-level behavior. Overall, the project validates semaphores as a reliable and flexible tool for managing concurrency and offers a strong foundation for further exploration of operating-system synchronization techniques.
